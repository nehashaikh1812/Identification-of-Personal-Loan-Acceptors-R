# Identification-of-Personal-Loan-Acceptors-R

Problem statement: The Universal Bank is interested in growing it's base of asset customers to bring in more loan business. They are planning to run a marketing campaign to convert liability customers to asset customers. Given this type of targeted marketing, the goal of my analysis is to analyze customer behaviour in terms of various attributes and look for a combination of factors that make a customer more likely to accept a personal loan.

The predictive model that I have used in this case is Logistic Regression Classifier. The dataset constitutes information about 5000 customers. Following is a description of the attributes that I have used to study customer behaviour.

Age- Customerâ€™s age in completed years

Experience- Number of years of professional experience

Income- Annual income of the customer ($000s)

Family- Size Family size of the customer

CCAvg- Average spending on credit cards per month ($000s)
